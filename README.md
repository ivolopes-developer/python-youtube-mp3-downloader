# Youtube to MP3 in Python
Dependencies:
- pip install youtube_dl


## Why?! '-'
All online youtube converters stopped working in my browser, probably because of the extensions I use. (anti pop-ups, ad blocks etc etc...)

So, as I don't like to open websites full of pop ups and advertisements. I made a program to be able to convert the video I want without having to worry.


### Some Images:
you start the program ( python demo.py (on terminal) ) and input the url of the video you want to convert into mp3
![print1](/imgs/img1.png)

Will show you some infos about the download process
![print2](/imgs/img2.png)

And voila, you have the mp3 file on the same path that is your's demo.py :D  
note: ads free '-'
